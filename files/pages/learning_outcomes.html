                <h3><i class="fas fa-headphones-alt"></i> Listening/Watching-Comprehension:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pupils will be able to get ready for listening/watching by activating prior knowledge and making simple predictions.</li>
                    <li>They will be able to comprehend the main topic of the content when listening or watching it as a whole.</li>
                    <li>They will learn to make meaning by checking their predictions, classifying components (like grouping words with visuals), and internalizing the content.</li>
                    <li>Finally, they will be able to convey their personal thoughts and feelings about the listening/watching process in a very simple way.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Reading-Comprehension:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pupils will be able to prepare for reading by activating past experiences and making simple predictions.</li>
                    <li>They will be able to grasp the general topic of the content by skimming (looking quickly) and recognize basic details by scanning.</li>
                    <li>They will learn to make meaning by checking predictions, comparing basic elements, and making simple, meaningful inferences from the text.</li>
                    <li>They will also be able to convey their knowledge and feelings about the reading process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Speaking-Expression:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pupils will be able to get ready for speaking by becoming familiar with model content through repetition and imitation.</li>
                    <li>They will be able to organize and form simple new verbal content (such as in short monologues, dialogues, or show-and-tell) by imitating models.</li>
                    <li>They will be able to select and use appropriate pronunciation, target words, and language chunks in both prepared and impromptu speaking situations.</li>
                    <li>They will also reorganize this information to engage in verbal communication with others and reflect on the speaking process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> Writing-Expression:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pupils will be able to get ready for writing by activating prior knowledge and understanding the assigned task.</li>
                    <li>They will be able to copy model/example content to gain familiarity and develop manual skills.</li>
                    <li>They will learn to organize and form a very simple, short, and meaningful content based on a provided model.</li>
                    <li>They will practice constructing content by using target words and language chunks to express simple messages clearly.</li>
                    <li>They will also engage in simple written communication by sharing reconstructed information with others and reflect on the writing process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i> Supportive Skills (Vocabulary, Grammar, Pronunciation):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Pupils will be able to select and use the target vocabulary (classroom furniture, objects, devices, and colours) accurately, spontaneously, and appropriately when communicating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Pupils will be able to select and use target "language chunks" (e.g., "What's it? It's a chair.") accurately and spontaneously. This is achieved automatically through repetition and acting out, <em>without</em> knowing, analyzing, or thinking about grammatical rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> Pupils will be able to select and use the target phonological elements (sounds, pronunciation, and intonation) accurately, authentically, and naturally when communicating. This includes recognizing sounds in different contexts and reinforcing them through repetition.</li>
                </ul>
